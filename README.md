#Lynn's NYCsee and Do List

![nycsee](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11340887/18846339/69be9c18-83f3-11e6-92b3-dd7e8b2684eb.jpg "NYCsee home page")

Making a fun play on the C / see in "NYC", this is an list-making app for Lynn's friends to suggest things for her to do and see while she is in NYC.

Users can suggest things to do, add specifics (ie websites or helpful info "only on Saturdays thru November")

##Project MVP
- CRUD app 
- allows users to suggest activities
- maintain list of previous suggestions

###User Story
1. User will create an account on first visit:
    * screen name
    * email address 
    * password
2. Returning user will log in
3. User can create a new "suggestion" 
  * form for entering idea contains:
    * primary description of idea
    * provide a web link (optional field)
    * other specifics (ie "try the such and such drink")
4. Display all ideas
    * chronological list of ideas  
5. User can log out when desired (log out link)

##Technologies
For this project, I have used the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Firebase
- Babel
- Webpack
- GitHub

##Future Improvements (random ideas, in no particular order)
- show completed activities
- allow users to comment on another user's idea
- add a randomizer for selecting the thing to do 
- users can attach a photo to their suggestion
- email password reset if user forgets password
- add edit button for user to edit only their submissions
- experiment with Google or Facebook login ?
- add gallery of photos from completed activities?
- allow users to vote on other ideas
    * display posts by most popular ideas (by user votes)
- filter by categories
- add category ( food / sightseeing / theatre / event / adventure) 
- add price range (0-5 stars, free => expensive) radio buttons (see example in Bookmarks)
- amount of time required (quick, daytime, nightime, all day, overnighter) radio buttons

##Can't get this to work
I'm trying to grab the friendlier "screenName" from the user's profile.
I can console.log it but can't figure out how to use it in the html
need to add edit (and delete) for original author, comment for other users
screen name instead of email address
error messages? show on screen not just in console
