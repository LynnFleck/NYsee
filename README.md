# NYsee
Making a fun play on the C / see in "NYC", this is an list-making app for Lynn's friends to suggest things for her to do and see while she is in NYC.

Users will be able to suggest things to do, add specifics (ie websites or helpful info "only on Saturdays thru November"), pricing info, amount of time needed, location, type of activity, etc) 

##Project MVP
- CRUD app 
- allows users to suggest activities
- allows users to comment on activities

###User Story
1. Index has login or register form
    * user creates an account
        * email address 
        * password
2. Home page  
  * form for entering idea
    * primary description
    * price range (0-5 stars, free => expensive) radio buttons? check boxes?
    * provide a web link (optional)
    * other specifics (try the such and such drink)
    * location 
    * amount of time required (quick, daytime, nightime, all day, overnighter)
  * sidebars/other divs will show 
    * categories
    * most popular ideas (by user votes)
    * completed activities
3. Logout link

##Technologies
For this project, I'll be using the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Firebase
- Babel
- Webpack
- GitHub

##Next Steps
- determine most difficult piece - build and test
    * setting up all the database elements, displaying them in different ways
    * figuring out how to attach another user's comment to a list item
- sketch out wireframe on paper
- pseudocode 
- determine what database elements are needed
    * research different selection options (radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns)
- rough out the design (photoshop)
- rough out the css and html
- determine what React components will be needed, which have state

##Bonuses
- users can attach a photo to their suggestion
- what if user forgets password? reset available?
- users cannot delete info, but can they edit after submitting?
- experiment with Google or Facebook login ?
- user login - Perhaps only if they want to edit their info or comment on other info
- add a randomizer for selecting the thing to do 
- let users vote on what I should do
- display list of most popular suggestions
- gallery of photos from completed activities?
